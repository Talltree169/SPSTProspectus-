                          Welcome to St Paul and St Timothy’s Catholic Infant School. We are a large, four-form entry school, set in the Liverpool suburb of West Derby. We cater for children aged 4 -7 years of age.<br><br>
                          It is our great honour to work with our dedicated governors, to lead this successful and thriving Catholic school. It is our mission to provide the best quality Catholic education for the whole child, working together with parents, carers, grandparents and our Catholic community. We strive to promote the Gospel values through our mission statement: ‘Love – Learn – Believe – Achieve, in the spirit of Jesus.’<br><br>
                          At St Paul and St Timothy’s, we always put our children first.  The health, safety and wellbeing of our children is our primary concern. We have three simple rules to help keep our children happy and safe: ‘Ready, Respect, Safe.’ We also use ROAR. This is a programme which helps children to build resilience and support their mental health and wellbeing.<br><br>
                          Our experienced team provide a curriculum which will stimulate, inspire and raise standards for every child in our school.  We have high expectations of all in our school community and everyone is encouraged to work hard and do their best, become confident, articulate and use their abilities to the full.<br><br>
                          At St Paul and St Timothy’s, we are very proud of our children and school.  If you visit, you will experience first-hand the happy, inclusive ethos and excitement for learning within our school community.<br><br>
                          If you have any further questions, please do not hesitate to get in contact.<br><br>

          <p class="mx-auto tm-section-desc text-center">
            At St Paul and St Timothy’s Catholic Infant School, we ensure children learn in a safe, caring and enriching environment. Our curriculum offers opportunities for children to learn about healthy relationships. Children are taught to identify trusted adults at home and in school. They are taught to tell a trusted adult if someone does something to make them feel unhappy, hurt or uncomfortable. We act in the best interests of the child, ensuring their views and wishes are heard and acted upon. Safeguarding children and promoting their welfare is a shared responsibility within our school and together with partner agencies.<br><br>

            As a school we have a statutory responsibility to share any concerns, we might have about a child in need of protection, with other agencies and in particular police, health and children’s services.<br><br>
            Schools are not able to investigate child protection concerns but have a legal duty to refer them. In most instances the school will be able to inform the parents/carer of its need to make a referral.<br><br>
            
            However, sometimes the school is advised by children’s services or police that the parent/carer cannot be informed whilst they investigate the matter. We understand the anxiety parents/carers may feel when they are not told about any concerns from the outset. The school follows legislation that aims to act in the interests of the child. The school will always seek to work in partnership with parents/carers and other agencies to ensure the best possible outcomes for the child and family.<br><br>

            <p class="mx-auto tm-section-desc">
              <h2>"Love, Learn, Believe, Achieve"</h2><br><br>
              At St. Paul and St. Timothy’s Catholic Infant School we celebrate the individual differences and gifts that God has blessed each and every one of us with.<br><br>

              “The mission of schools … is to develop an understanding of all that is true, good and beautiful.”<br><br>
              “An inclusive education finds a place for all.”<br><br>
              “Educating is an act of love; it is like giving life.” (Pope Francis)<br><br>

              We believe each new day brings the opportunity to express our love for God and one another. We provide a supportive, yet challenging, learning environment where each individual is able to develop their abilities and gifts. Our school is a place where children and adults can express their belief in God; develop belief in themselves and others. We believe everyone in our school community can achieve, whatever their ability. Each achievement is as unique as each individual and all are celebrated. We aspire to equip all in our school community to proclaim the Good News and “live life to the full”.<br><br>
            </p>

            Relationships and communication are at the heart of all we do. We recognise that most children self-regulate their behaviour and demonstrate they are Ready, Respectful and Safe. Research shows that co-regulation and supportive conversations are the most effective tool to support children who are developing these skills. Our Ethos is supported by trauma informed research, practise and whole staff training. <br><br>

              Children can choose daily from a variety of delicious meals. If your child has any allergies or other dietary requirements, please make an appointment to speak to our cook. All of our meals are prepared on site by our wonderful catering team, with fresh, locally sourced ingredients. Our menus meet the nutritional standards for schools.<br> <br>

              <b>3. Do the children have a snack?</b><br>
              We provide snack for the children each day. They have either toast or a biscuit with milk or water. Fruit is available throughout the day. Snack is paid for through our online payment system – Arbor.<br> <br>

              <b>4. What is Pupil Premium?</b><br>
              Pupil Premium provides additional funding on top of the main funding a school receives. If you are in receipt of benefits your child may be eligible for extra support through this funding.
              We use this additional funding to improve the learning for eligible children through additional support and interventions. If you think your child is entitled to Pupil Premium, please check on the link below.
              This may entitle your child to additional support, a free place at one of our after-school clubs or other initiatives.<br> <br>

              Please check and register your child on this link. <a href="https://liverpool.gov.uk/benefits/free-school-meals/application-form/">https://liverpool.gov.uk/benefits/free-school-meals/application-form/</a><br> <br>
